  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #72da10; font-weight: bolder;">First GENERATION COMPUTERS</h2>

  <form style="margin-left: 4vw;font-weight: bold;">
    <li>The first generation of computers (1946-1959) used vacuum tubes as the primary electronic component.
    </li>
    <li>These computers were massive, room-sized machines that consumed a lot of power and generated significant heat.
    </li>
    <li>The first generation computers used machine language programming, which was difficult to learn and use.
    </li>
    <li>Examples of first-generation computers include ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) and UNIVAC I
      (Universal Automatic Computer).
    </li>
    <li>First-generation computers were primarily used for scientific and military applications, such as calculations
      and data processing.</li>

             <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #1dc6d9; font-weight: bolder;">SECOND GENERATION COMPUTERS</h2>
           
             <form style="margin-left: 4vw;font-weight: bold;">
               <li>The second generation of computers (1959-1965) used transistors instead of vacuum tubes, making them smaller, faster, and more reliable.

               </li>
               <li>Transistors also reduced power consumption and heat generation, making computers more practical for everyday use.

               </li>
               <li>Second-generation computers introduced assembly languages and compilers, making programming easier and more efficient.

               </li>
               <li>Magnetic tapes and disks were used for storage, and printers were used for output.

               </li>
               <li>Examples of second-generation computers include the IBM 1401 and the DEC PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1).</li>

                      <form style="margin-left: 4vw;font-weight: bold;">
                        <li>The third generation of computers (1965-1980) used integrated circuits (ICs) and microprocessors, further miniaturizing computer hardware.

         
                        </li>
                        <li>Third-generation computers introduced operating systems, such as UNIX and Windows, which managed computer resources and provided a platform for applications.

         
                        </li>
                        <li>ICs contained multiple transistors and other components on a single chip of silicon, increasing processing power and reducing cost.

         
                        </li>
                        <li>Memory storage expanded to include floppy disks and hard disks, and input/output devices like keyboards and monitors became standard.

         
                        </li>
                        <li>Examples of third-generation computers include the IBM System/360 and the Apple II, which popularized personal computing.</li>
